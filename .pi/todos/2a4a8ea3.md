## Done

Added `PlaybackPreferences` class using SharedPreferences to persist position per book.

### Implementation
- **Book ID**: Hash of bundle path
- **Save**: Every ~5 seconds during playback + on screen dispose
- **Restore**: On startup, seek to saved position and update page/span

### Files
- `player/app/.../data/PlaybackPreferences.kt` - New preferences helper
- `player/app/.../ui/PlayerScreen.kt` - Save/restore integration
