Add explicit checks that each SMIL `textRef` target maps to real rendered content and that mapping is consistent.

## Why
Prevents silent desynchronization when fragment IDs or structure don’t line up.

## Acceptance criteria
- Report unresolved `textRef` targets with chapter/span context.
- Report spans with timing but no mapped geometry/text.
- Configurable mode: warn (default) vs fail compilation (`--strict`).
