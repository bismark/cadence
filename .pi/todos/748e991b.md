## Closed - Low Priority

Already using Media3 (`androidx.media3:media3-exoplayer:1.2.0`). The TODO title was misleading - we're not on legacy ExoPlayer.

Version bump to latest (1.5.x) is routine maintenance:
- Our usage is basic (play/pause/seek)
- No known bugs affecting us
- Can update during general dependency refresh

No action needed now.
