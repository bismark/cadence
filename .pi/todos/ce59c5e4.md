During compile, detect known high-risk EPUB features and emit actionable warnings instead of failing silently.

## Initial detections
- tables / complex table layout
- floats / absolute positioning
- ruby / MathML / SVG-heavy text flow
- RTL / vertical writing modes
- fixed-layout indicators

## Acceptance criteria
- Warnings include file/chapter and detected feature.
- Summary section groups counts by feature type.
- Output clearly distinguishes 'unsupported' vs 'degraded but compiled'.
