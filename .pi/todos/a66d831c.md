From instrumentation, startup bundle load is dominated by decoding page JSON (~110ms for 69 pages). Revisit with a lazy-loading design:

## Goal
Reduce initial app startup latency by avoiding eager decode of all `pages/*.json` at bundle load.

## Candidate approach
- Keep metadata/spans/toc eager.
- Build lightweight page index (pageIndex -> file path/offset).
- Load/decode only current page initially.
- Optionally prefetch neighbors (current±1) in background.
- Add small LRU cache for decoded pages.
- Ensure highlight/page navigation behavior remains unchanged.

## Validation
- Compare `CadencePerf` startup logs before/after:
  - `bundle load ... total=...`
  - perceived time to first render
- Confirm no regressions in page turns, tap hit-testing, and active span highlighting.
