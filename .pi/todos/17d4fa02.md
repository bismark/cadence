Goal: one surgical visual tuning pass after v10.

Scope:
- Keep safe normalized CSS path in `compiler/src/index.ts` (no broad publisher CSS reinjection).
- Adjust reading measure and line-height to more closely match Thorium screenshot reference.
- Keep paragraph indent behavior restored.

Acceptance:
- No left-edge fragment regression.
- First-line indents remain visible.
- Screenshot on emulator shows improved rhythm/measure vs v10 baseline.

Implemented compact typography tuning in `compiler/src/index.ts` and validated on emulator:

- Increased aligned-path line-height slightly (`profile.lineHeight + 0.06`) for better reading rhythm.
- Kept safe normalization path (no broad publisher CSS reintroduction).
- Added narrow paragraph side insets (`p { margin-left/right: 0.5em; }`) instead of `.cadence-content` padding to avoid triggering the prior left-fragment column regression.
- Preserved paragraph first-line indentation and pre/blockquote handling.

Validation:
- `cd compiler && npm run build`
- `cd compiler && npm test`
- Built and pushed `/tmp/moby-dick-aligned-render-fidelity-v11b.bundle`.
- Emulator screenshot confirms: no left fragment column, visible indents, and improved Thorium-like flow compared to v10.
