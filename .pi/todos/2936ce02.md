## Task
Add optional ZIP compression for bundle output (currently outputs uncompressed directory).

## Context
- Audio (95%+ of size) is already compressed (Opus)
- JSON files (pages, spans, meta) would benefit from ZIP compression
- Current `--no-zip` flag exists but ZIP output isn't implemented

## Implementation

### Compiler
- Use Node.js `archiver` or similar to create ZIP
- Keep `--no-zip` flag for debugging (outputs directory)
- Default to ZIP output for production use

### Player
- **Currently only supports directory bundles** (BundleLoader.kt)
- Options:
  1. Extract ZIP on first load to app cache, then read as directory
  2. Read directly from ZIP via `java.util.zip.ZipFile`
- Option 1 is simpler; option 2 avoids duplication but more code

## Priority
Low - bundles are small enough that this isn't urgent
