Build concatenation order from first appearance in the timed span stream rather than OPF manifest order.

## Why
Some books have manifest ordering that differs from playback intent.

## Acceptance criteria
- Audio concatenation order derives from sorted spans.
- Offsets remain deterministic and validated.
- Add regression test fixture where manifest order is intentionally misleading.
