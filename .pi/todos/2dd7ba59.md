Build a curated fixture set and lightweight regression workflow to validate compiler behavior across known risk patterns.

## Goal
Catch layout/sync regressions early and make support claims measurable.

## Fixture targets (initial)
- Relative resource resolution (CSS/images/fonts)
- Broken/missing SMIL fragment targets
- nav vs NCX TOC variants
- Audio manifest order mismatch vs span-use order
- Basic RTL chapter
- Table/float-heavy chapter
- Image-heavy chapter

## Implementation outline
- Add fixtures under `compiler/test/fixtures/` with short README per fixture describing expected outcomes.
- Add a smoke command/script to compile all fixtures and summarize warnings/errors.
- Add minimal assertions/checks for key invariants (non-zero pages/spans, mapping coverage, no fatal validation errors).

## Acceptance criteria
- At least 5 high-value fixtures added and documented.
- One command runs full smoke suite locally.
- CI-friendly output and baseline expectations for each fixture.
