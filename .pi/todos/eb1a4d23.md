Issue: Bottom bar buttons are too small as touch targets on the physical device.

Fix: Increase button size/padding and hit target in PlayerScreen controls (EInkButton / bottom bar row). Consider minimum touch target (48dp) and spacing.

Reference: player/app/.../ui/PlayerScreen.kt bottom bar Row + EInkButton.

### Completed
- Increased bottom-bar touch targets in `player/app/src/main/java/com/cadence/player/ui/PlayerScreen.kt`:
  - `EInkButton` now supports configurable minimum target size and defaults to `minHeight = 56.dp`.
  - Added `sizeIn(minWidth, minHeight)` so the clickable area is enlarged regardless of label length.
  - Increased internal button padding for easier taps.
- Updated control-row button widths for better on-device hitability:
  - Prev/Next/Debug buttons use `minWidth = 120.dp`.
  - Play/Pause button uses `minWidth = 132.dp`.
- Kept the controls compact enough to remain within the compiler-reserved bottom safe margin (`200px` on the Manta profile), avoiding safe-render-area changes.

### Verification
- Ran required player verification:
  - `cd player && ./scripts/verify.sh`
- Result: **BUILD SUCCESSFUL** (`compileDebugKotlin`, `detekt`, `lintDebug`, `buildHealth`).
