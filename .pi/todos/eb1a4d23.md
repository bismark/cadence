Issue: Bottom bar buttons are too small as touch targets on the physical device.

Fix: Increase button size/padding and hit target in PlayerScreen controls (EInkButton / bottom bar row). Consider minimum touch target (48dp) and spacing.

Reference: player/app/.../ui/PlayerScreen.kt bottom bar Row + EInkButton.
