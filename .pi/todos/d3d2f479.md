Goal: Support 2x playback speed. Need to decide whether to pre-render faster audio in compiler (e.g., time-stretch) or implement playback speed in player (ExoPlayer setPlaybackParameters).

Considerations:
- Player approach keeps a single bundle and dynamic speed control, but must keep span timing aligned at different speeds (UI highlights should scale with playback rate).
- Compiler approach would require generating a second audio track and adjusted timings, increasing bundle size.

Reference: player AudioPlayer.kt, compiler audio concat/align.
