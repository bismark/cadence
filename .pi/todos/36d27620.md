Issue: compiler/src/align/getSentenceRanges.ts sets sentence start from a word in one audio file but end timestamp can come from a word in a different audio file, producing invalid range.

Fix: When end word audiofile differs from start audiofile, clamp end to last word in the start audiofile or split sentence timing across files.

Reference: getSentenceRanges() timestamp selection in compiler/src/align/getSentenceRanges.ts.
