## Won't Fix

Visual press feedback (gray background on touch) would cause additional e-ink refreshes that likely feel worse than no feedback due to ~300ms refresh latency.

Current behavior is probably appropriate for e-ink. Will revisit after testing on real Supernote device.

**Alternatives considered:**
- Haptic feedback (device-dependent)
- The span highlight update already provides some visual feedback
