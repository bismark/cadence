Goal: When the active span changes (next sentence), update highlights in a single refresh so the old sentence unhighlights at the same time as the next sentence highlights. Avoid multiple e-ink refreshes per sentence change.

Notes:
- Investigate highlight update flow in PlayerScreen/PageRenderer; ensure state updates are batched.
- Consider deferring UI update until both old/new span IDs are ready, or update only when span actually changes.

Reference: player/app/.../ui/PlayerScreen.kt and PageRenderer.kt highlight logic.
