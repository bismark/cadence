Maintain the architecture rule: **player is a dumb painter**.

Scope:
- Tune profile defaults (margins, measure, line height, toolbar reserve) to improve readability parity with Thorium while preserving e-ink constraints.
- Validate against screenshot comparisons and reading comfort on Supernote profile.
- Ensure tuning stays compiler-side; player should not compensate at runtime.

Acceptance criteria:
- Updated profile values documented with rationale.
- Before/after screenshots show improved rhythm and density.
- No additional client-side layout calculations introduced.
