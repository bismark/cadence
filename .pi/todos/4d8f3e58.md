Maintain the architecture rule: **player is a dumb painter**.

Scope:
- Add repeatable visual regression checks comparing:
  1) compiler preview output
  2) player render output on emulator/device
- Include representative fixtures (Moby Dick + media overlays fixture) and selected pages/timestamps.
- Define tolerances and report diff heatmaps/artifacts.

Acceptance criteria:
- CI/local command exists for visual parity checks.
- Rendering regressions in text spacing/baselines/rect placement are caught automatically.
- Test docs include how to update baselines responsibly.
