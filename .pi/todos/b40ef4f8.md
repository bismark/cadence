Issue: compiler/src/index.ts alignEPUB skip path (transcriptionConsumedPct > 80) leaves transcriptionOffset null, causing remaining chapters to skip alignment.

Fix: When skipping search, set transcriptionOffset to lastTranscriptionOffset (or a computed end offset) so alignment can continue predictably.

Reference: alignEPUB search skip branch in compiler/src/index.ts.
