Add a project-level guardrail that rendering/layout intelligence lives in the compiler.

Scope:
- Document rule in `CLAUDE.md` and/or `docs/architecture`:
  - player draws precomputed geometry
  - no client line breaking, baseline estimation, whitespace normalization, typography correction
- Add PR checklist item for compiler/player rendering changes.
- Add code comments in renderer + paginator to reinforce boundary.

Acceptance criteria:
- Rule is visible in contributor docs.
- New rendering PRs include explicit statement that the rule is preserved.
- Violations are easy to spot during review.
