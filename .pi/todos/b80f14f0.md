# Player: ignore taps on spans without timestamps (avoid seek loop)

## Fix Applied
- Added `CadenceBundle.findNextSpanAfter()` for jumping to next timed span
- Added `hasValidTiming()` check in `PlayerScreen`
- Tapping spans with invalid timing now no-ops
- Play button now seeks to the next timed span when paused
- Background tap uses the same play/pause logic
- Page navigation seeks only when target span has valid timing

## Files
- `player/app/src/main/java/com/cadence/player/ui/PlayerScreen.kt`
- `player/app/src/main/java/com/cadence/player/data/Bundle.kt`

## Behavior
- Tap on untimed section: no action
- Play from untimed position: jumps to next timed span
