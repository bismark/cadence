Issue: Swiping/scrolling on the screen can trigger playback because background tap detection is too permissive.

Fix: Tighten tap detection (e.g., add gesture threshold, distinguish tap vs drag) in PageRenderer/onBackgroundTap handling. Consider using pointer input to require minimal movement and short duration.

Reference: player/app/.../ui/PageRenderer.kt and PlayerScreen background tap handler.

## Implementation (2026-02-05)
- Replaced permissive `detectTapGestures` handling in `PageRenderer` with custom strict tap detection via `awaitEachGesture`.
- Added strict filters before treating input as tap:
  - max movement: `viewConfiguration.touchSlop * 0.5f`
  - max duration: `220ms`
  - reject multi-touch gestures
- Only trigger `onSpanTap` / `onBackgroundTap` when gesture passes strict tap checks.
- Verified compilation with `cd player && ./gradlew :app:compileDebugKotlin`.
