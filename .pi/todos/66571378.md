Issue: Swiping/scrolling on the screen can trigger playback because background tap detection is too permissive.

Fix: Tighten tap detection (e.g., add gesture threshold, distinguish tap vs drag) in PageRenderer/onBackgroundTap handling. Consider using pointer input to require minimal movement and short duration.

Reference: player/app/.../ui/PageRenderer.kt and PlayerScreen background tap handler.
