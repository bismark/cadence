Create a single source-of-truth support matrix that documents what Cadence currently supports, partially supports, or does not support for EPUB compilation/playback.

## Goal
Set clear expectations for scope and behavior so we can stay pragmatic (not a full EPUB renderer) while still shipping reliably.

## Deliverable
- New doc (suggested path): `docs/epub-support-matrix.md`

## Include
- Feature area (SMIL mapping, CSS/layout fidelity, resources/images/fonts, TOC/nav, audio sequencing, RTL, tables/floats, ruby/MathML/SVG, fixed-layout, scripting/interactivity, etc.)
- Status: Supported / Partial / Unsupported
- Degradation behavior: warn / compile-fail (`--strict`) / runtime limitation
- Linked TODO IDs for planned improvements
- Last-reviewed date and owner

## Acceptance criteria
- Matrix covers all major compile/runtime feature areas.
- Every row has explicit behavior when unsupported.
- Matrix links to relevant TODOs and is referenced from compiler README.
