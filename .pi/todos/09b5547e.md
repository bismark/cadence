## Fixed

Used `playWhenReady` instead of `isPlaying` to report playback state. `isPlaying` can be momentarily false during seek/buffer operations even when user intends to play, causing button flash.

Changes:
- `onIsPlayingChanged`: report `exoPlayer.playWhenReady` instead of `isPlaying`
- `onPlaybackStateChanged(STATE_ENDED)`: explicitly set `_isPlaying.value = false`
- `togglePlayPause`: check `playWhenReady` for consistency
