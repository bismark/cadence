## Questions to Answer
1. Does audio keep playing when app is backgrounded?
2. When foregrounded, does UI update to show correct current section?

## Current State
Unknown - needs testing. ExoPlayer can support background playback but may require:
- Foreground Service with notification
- Wake lock (now default in Media3 1.9.0)
- Proper lifecycle handling in PlayerScreen

## Android Requirements for Background Audio
- **Foreground Service** - Required for reliable background playback on modern Android
- **Media notification** - Play/pause controls in notification/lock screen
- **Audio focus** - Handle interruptions (calls, other apps)
- **Wake lock** - Prevent CPU sleep during playback

## Implementation Considerations
- `MediaSessionService` or manual foreground service
- Update UI state when returning to foreground (sync position, activeSpan, page)
- Handle audio focus changes (pause on call, duck for notifications)
- Battery impact on e-ink device

## Files
- `player/app/src/main/java/com/cadence/player/audio/AudioPlayer.kt`
- `player/app/src/main/java/com/cadence/player/ui/PlayerScreen.kt`
- May need new Service class

## Priority
Medium - important for real-world audiobook use
