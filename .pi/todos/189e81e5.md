`docs/bundle-format.md` needs a full accuracy pass against current compiler/player behavior.

Known drift areas to verify/document:
- Compact/internal span IDs (non-semantic)
- Current page JSON fields and semantics
- `TextStyle` fields (`inkGray` vs legacy `color` examples)
- Page file naming conventions across compile/align flows
- Notes on minified JSON output and JSONL spans

Acceptance:
- All examples parse against current Kotlin data classes
- Field descriptions match actual emitted compiler output
- Include at least one fixture-derived real sample block

Completed 2026-02-10:
- Rewrote `docs/bundle-format.md` to match current emitted schema.
- Added `styles.json` documentation and `styleId`-based `TextRun` shape.
- Updated examples for compact internal span IDs (`s*`).
- Clarified page filename conventions and player ordering by `pageIndex`.
- Updated player bundle location docs to include `styles.json` (`player/README.md`).
