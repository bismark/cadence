## Goal
Allow compiling plain audiobooks (MP3/M4B, no text) by transcribing via STT.

## Pipeline
1. Input: audiobook files (MP3, M4B, etc.)
2. Run STT with word-level timestamps (Whisper, etc.)
3. Generate EPUB structure from transcription
4. Create timing data from STT timestamps
5. Continue with normal bundle compilation

## Considerations
- Chapter detection (silence detection, M4B chapters, manual splits)
- Transcription accuracy
- Speaker identification (multiple narrators)
- Punctuation and paragraph detection
- Cost if using cloud STT APIs
- Handling music/sound effects

## Dependencies
- STT engine (Whisper recommended - good timestamps)
- EPUB generation utilities
