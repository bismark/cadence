Improve XHTML normalization/rendering so we keep useful publisher CSS while still enforcing device profile constraints.

## Why
Current normalization strips too much styling and can degrade layout.

## Acceptance criteria
- Book CSS is loaded by default for reflowable content.
- Profile CSS remains authoritative for viewport/margins/font policy.
- Add a safe-list/deny-list for problematic rules (e.g. scripts/unsafe constructs).
- Document precedence rules between publisher CSS and profile CSS.
