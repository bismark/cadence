Issue: writeBundleAlignedUncompressed in compiler/src/index.ts did not clear existing outputDir, leaving stale pages that loadBundle() still reads. This causes mismatched page counts when re-running align --no-zip.

Fix: Remove outputDir before writing (mirror writeBundleUncompressed behavior).

Reference: writeBundleAlignedUncompressed in compiler/src/index.ts.
