Add pragmatic support for right-to-left reading in straightforward Arabic/Hebrew reflowable EPUBs.

## Scope
- Respect document/element `dir`.
- Preserve bidi behavior in extracted runs/rect mapping.
- No goal of full complex-script perfection.

## Acceptance criteria
- RTL chapters paginate in correct visual direction/order.
- Span rect extraction remains stable for RTL lines.
- Add at least one RTL smoke fixture and warning for unsupported mixed cases.
