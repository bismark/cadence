# Extract @storyteller-platform/epub package - NOT NEEDED

After analysis, we determined we don't need Storyteller's epub package because:

1. Our existing `compiler/src/epub/` handles reading
2. We can output directly to our bundle format instead of writing modified EPUBs
3. The alignment produces span IDs + timing → feeds directly into bundle generation

The flow will be:
```
EPUB + audio → align → inject spans + timing → Chromium render → bundle
```

No SMIL/EPUB writing required!
