## Feature
Add a library screen that displays all available bundles and allows users to select which book to read.

## Requirements
- [ ] Scan a directory (e.g., `/sdcard/Download/cadence-bundles/`) for available bundles
- [ ] Display library grid/list with book metadata (title, author, cover if available)
- [ ] Navigate from library to player when a book is selected
- [ ] Return to library from player (back navigation)

## UI Considerations
- Library as the app's home screen
- Show reading progress per book (ties into TODO-2a4a8ea3 persistence)
- Consider cover image support (may need compiler changes to extract/include covers)
- E-ink friendly UI (minimal animations, high contrast)

## Implementation
- New `LibraryScreen` composable
- `BundleRepository` to scan and list available bundles
- Navigation component or simple state-based screen switching
- Parse `meta.json` from each bundle for display info

## Relevant Files
- `player/app/.../ui/PlayerScreen.kt` - Existing player UI
- `player/app/.../data/BundleLoader.kt` - Bundle loading logic to extend
