`player/app/src/main/java/com/cadence/player/data/Bundle.kt` builds audio path as:

`"$basePath/${meta.audioFile}"`

`meta.audioFile` comes from bundle metadata and is currently not validated. A crafted bundle can use path traversal segments (for example `../../...`) to resolve outside the bundle directory and make the player open unintended files.

## Fix
Validate/canonicalize `meta.audioFile` and enforce that the resolved path remains inside `basePath`.

## Acceptance
- Rejects traversal and absolute-path values in `meta.audioFile`.
- Accepts expected bundle-local filenames (e.g. `audio.opus`, `audio.m4a`).
- Fails fast with a clear error when invalid.
